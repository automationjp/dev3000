## Quick Start

### üöÄ For Beginners

**Never used dev3000?** Start here:

```bash
# 1. Install dev3000 globally from automationjp/dev3000 (one-time setup)
pnpm install -g github:automationjp/dev3000

# 2. Go to ANY Next.js/React/Vite project (existing or new)
cd /path/to/your/project

# 3. Start dev3000 (replaces "npm run dev")
dev3000
```

That's it! Your app is now fully monitored. Visit:
- **Your App**: http://localhost:3000
- **Logs Viewer**: http://localhost:3684/logs (see everything happening in real-time)

**Works with ANY project**: No configuration files needed. dev3000 automatically detects your package manager and framework.

**What happens next?** When you encounter a bug, just ask your AI assistant:
```
"fix my app"
```

dev3000 gives AI complete context: server logs, browser errors, network calls, screenshots - everything it needs to help you debug.

**Need detailed instructions?** Read the [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md).

### üê≥ For Local Development

```bash
pnpm install -g github:automationjp/dev3000
dev3000
```

### ü™ü For Windows Users (Docker Required)

**Windows**: dev3000's Chrome automation requires Docker/WSL2. Direct Windows installation doesn't work due to CDP limitations.

**Setup for YOUR Next.js project**:

1. **Clone this repository** (for Docker configuration):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/automationjp/dev3000.git
   cd dev3000
   ```

2. **Point Docker to YOUR project**:

   Edit `docker/docker-compose.yml` and change the volume mount:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     # Change this line to YOUR project path (WSL2 format):
     - /mnt/c/Users/YourName/Projects/my-nextjs-app:/app
     # Keep these lines as-is:
     - /app/node_modules
     - /app/.next
   ```

   **Path Examples**:
   - Windows `C:\Users\John\Projects\my-app` ‚Üí WSL2 `/mnt/c/Users/John/Projects/my-app`
   - Windows `D:\github\my-app` ‚Üí WSL2 `/mnt/d/github/my-app`

3. **Start dev3000**:
   ```bash
   make dev-up    # Starts Chrome on Windows + dev3000 in Docker
   make dev-logs  # View logs
   make dev-down  # Stop everything
   ```

**Access Points**:
- **Your App**: http://localhost:3000
- **Dev3000 UI**: http://localhost:3684
- **Logs Viewer**: http://localhost:3684/logs

**How it Works**:
- ‚úÖ Chrome runs on Windows host (full GPU acceleration)
- ‚úÖ dev3000 runs in Linux container (proper Unix tools)
- ‚úÖ Communication via CDP over `host.docker.internal`

**No configuration files needed in YOUR project** - just point the volume mount to your Next.js app directory!

See [Docker Setup Guide](docker/README.md) and [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md#docker-installation-required-for-windows) for detailed instructions.

## AI Integration with Dynamic Enhancement

**dev3000 features smart MCP integration that gracefully enhances capabilities when specialized MCPs are available!**

### üéØ Core Experience (Always Available)
When you run `dev3000`, you get:
- **dev3000 MCP** - Complete debugging and browser automation tools
- Full log analysis, error detection, interaction replay
- Comprehensive browser automation and screenshot capture

### ‚ö° Enhanced Experience (When Available)
dev3000 **automatically discovers** and integrates with:
- **chrome-devtools MCP** - Advanced browser inspection, DOM analysis, performance profiling
- **nextjs-dev MCP** - Framework-specific build analysis, SSR debugging, hydration troubleshooting

### üöÄ Dynamic Capability Discovery
- **Real-time detection** of available MCP capabilities via log introspection
- **Context-aware suggestions** that match your current debugging scenario  
- **Zero manual configuration** - works out of the box
- **Intelligent caching** (5min TTL) for optimal performance

For **Claude Code**, no manual setup is required. Just run `dev3000` and start using AI commands:

```
fix my app
```

dev3000 will provide comprehensive analysis and, when enhanced MCPs are available, suggest additional capabilities like:
```
üîó AUGMENTED ANALYSIS AVAILABLE

dev3000 provided the core log analysis above. For deeper insights, consider also gathering:

Next.js Framework Analysis:
‚Ä¢ dev3000-nextjs-dev:debug_hydration() - Client-server hydration analysis
‚Ä¢ dev3000-nextjs-dev:analyze_build_process() - Deep build system insights

Browser-Side Analysis:
‚Ä¢ dev3000-chrome-devtools:inspect_element() - Deep DOM inspection
‚Ä¢ dev3000-chrome-devtools:start_performance_profile() - Client-side performance data

üí° Best approach: Use dev3000's log analysis as your foundation, then gather specific additional data as needed for a complete picture.
```

![dev3000 CLI](www/public/cli.gif)

## What it does

Creates a comprehensive log of your development session that AI assistants can easily understand. When you have a bug or issue, Claude can see your server output, browser console, network requests, and screenshots all in chronological order.

The tool monitors your app in a real browser and captures:

- Server logs and console output
- Browser console messages and errors
- Network requests and responses
- Automatic screenshots on navigation, errors, and key events
- Visual timeline at `http://localhost:3684/logs`

![dev3000 Logs Viewer](logs.jpg)

Logs are automatically saved with timestamps in `/var/log/dev3000/` (or temp directory) and rotated to keep the 10 most recent per project. Each instance has its own timestamped log file displayed when starting dev3000.

## dev3000: Smart Debugging Orchestrator

**dev3000 doesn't just work alone - it's designed to intelligently enhance its capabilities by orchestrating your entire MCP debugging ecosystem!** üéº

### üéØ How Smart Integration Works

**Core Mode** (dev3000 alone):
- Complete log analysis, browser automation, error detection, interaction replay
- All essential debugging functionality available immediately
- Zero dependencies - works great out of the box

**Enhanced Mode** (with specialized MCPs):
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Real-time detection of available MCP capabilities via log introspection
- **Capability-Aware Suggestions**: Context-sensitive recommendations based on discovered MCP functions  
- **Augmented Delegation**: Provides comprehensive dev3000 analysis PLUS enhanced MCP suggestions
- **Self-Updating Intelligence**: Automatically adapts when MCPs add new capabilities - no manual updates required

### üöÄ Key Innovation: Dynamic Capability Discovery

Unlike static integrations that become outdated, dev3000 features **living integration** that:

- **Introspects MCP Logs**: Analyzes Claude's MCP communication logs to discover available functions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Uses intelligent regex patterns to extract function names and descriptions
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatically classifies capabilities as "advanced" vs "basic"
- **Context Matching**: Prioritizes suggestions based on current error patterns
- **Cache Intelligence**: 5-minute caching for performance with automatic refresh

**Result**: You always get suggestions for the **latest available capabilities** from your MCPs, even when they update with new features you haven't seen yet!

### üöÄ Integration Benefits

**With nextjs-dev MCP:**
- Framework-specific build and runtime error analysis
- Server-side log correlation with dev3000's client-side data
- Next.js-specific fix suggestions (hydration, SSR, etc.)

**With chrome-devtools MCP:**
- Precise browser state inspection and control
- Detailed console error analysis beyond dev3000's capture
- DOM inspection for UI interaction failures

**Triple-Stack Power (dev3000 + nextjs-dev + chrome-devtools):**

```

### üîç Proactive Discovery

dev3000 can automatically discover other MCPs without manual configuration:

**Process Detection**: Scans for known MCP patterns in running processes
**Port Pinging**: Tests standard MCP ports with health checks
**Smart Logging**: All discovery attempts logged with `[D3K]` tags

```
[2025-01-XX] [D3K] MCP Discovery: Found nextjs-dev MCP via process detection
[2025-01-XX] [D3K] MCP Integration: Activated integrations [Next.js, Chrome DevTools]  
[2025-01-XX] [D3K] Fix Analysis: Using active MCP integrations for enhanced error analysis
```

**The result**: Instead of using debugging tools individually, you get an **orchestrated workflow** that leverages each tool's unique strengths systematically! üéº

### MCP Server Details

The MCP server runs at `http://localhost:3684/mcp` and provides these tools:

- `fix_my_app` - **Enhanced!** AI-powered debugging with dynamic MCP capability suggestions

**Automatic Configuration**: Claude Code users get MCP access automatically when running `dev3000`. The dynamic capability discovery works with any MCPs you have configured - no manual setup required!



## Using the Chrome Extension vs Playwright

dev3000 supports two monitoring modes:

### Default: Playwright Browser Automation

By default, dev3000 launches a Playwright-controlled Chrome instance for comprehensive monitoring.

### Alternative: Chrome Extension

For a lighter approach, install the dev3000 Chrome extension to monitor your existing browser session.

#### Installing the Chrome Extension

Since the extension isn't published to the Chrome Web Store, install it locally:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Navigate to your dev3000 installation directory and select the `chrome-extension` folder
5. The extension will now monitor localhost tabs automatically

#### Using with --servers-only

When using the Chrome extension, start dev3000 with the `--servers-only` flag to skip Playwright:

```bash
dev3000 --servers-only
```

#### Comparison

| Feature             | Playwright (Default)     | Chrome Extension        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Setup**           | Automatic                | Manual install required |
| **Performance**     | Higher resource usage    | Lightweight             |
| **Browser Control** | Full automation support  | Monitoring only         |
| **User Experience** | Separate browser window  | Your existing browser   |
| **Screenshots**     | Automatic on events      | Manual via extension    |
| **Best For**        | Automated testing, CI/CD | Development debugging   |

## Options

```bash
dev3000 [options]

  -p, --port <port>         Your app's port (default: 3000)
  --mcp-port <port>         MCP server port (default: 3684)
  -s, --script <script>     Package.json script to run (default: dev)
  --browser <path>          Full path to browser executable (e.g. Arc, custom Chrome)
  --servers-only            Run servers only, skip browser launch (use with Chrome extension)
  --profile-dir <dir>       Chrome profile directory (default: /tmp/dev3000-chrome-profile)
```

Examples:

```bash
# Custom port
dev3000 --port 5173

# Use Arc browser
dev3000 --browser '/Applications/Arc.app/Contents/MacOS/Arc'

# Use with Chrome extension (no Playwright)
dev3000 --servers-only

# Custom profile directory
dev3000 --profile-dir ./chrome-profile
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does dev3000 save my login state?

Yes, login state is saved automatically in a unique browser profile for each project. No need to re-login.

### How do I stop a dev3000 session?

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop everything (server, browser, and MCP server).

### Does dev3000 work with other frameworks besides Next.js?

Yes, it works with React, Vue, Vite, etc. Use `--script` to specify your dev command.

### Why do I see a warning about "sharp" during installation?

This warning is harmless and can be safely ignored. Sharp is an optional image optimization library used by Next.js, but dev3000 has image optimization disabled (`images: { unoptimized: true }` in next.config.mjs) since all images are served locally. The warning appears because pnpm wants to run sharp's build script, but the library is never actually used at runtime.

## Releasing (Maintainers Only)

**Note**: This fork does not publish to npm. For the official npm package, see the [upstream repository](https://github.com/vercel-labs/dev3000).

We use a semi-automated release process that handles testing while accommodating npm's 2FA requirement:

### Option 1: GitHub Actions + Manual Publish (Recommended)

1. Go to [Actions](https://github.com/automationjp/dev3000/actions) ‚Üí "Prepare Release"
2. Select release type (patch/minor/major) and run
3. Wait for tests to pass on all platforms
4. Download the release artifact (tarball)
5. Publish locally: `./scripts/publish.sh dev3000-*.tgz`

### Option 2: Local Release

```bash
./scripts/release.sh  # Creates tag and updates version
./scripts/publish.sh  # Publishes to npm (requires 2FA)
git push origin main --tags
```

The release script automatically handles re-releases by cleaning up existing tags if needed.

For detailed instructions, see [docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md](docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md).

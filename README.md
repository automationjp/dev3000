## What it does

Creates a comprehensive log of your development session that AI assistants can easily understand. When you have a bug or issue, Claude can see your server output, browser console, network requests, and screenshots all in chronological order.

The tool monitors your app in a real browser and captures:

- Server logs and console output
- Browser console messages and errors
- Network requests and responses
- Automatic screenshots on navigation, errors, and key events
- Visual timeline at `http://localhost:3684/logs`

![dev3000 Logs Viewer](logs.jpg)

Logs are automatically saved with timestamps in `~/.d3k/logs/` and rotated to keep the 10 most recent per project. Each instance has its own timestamped log file displayed when starting dev3000.

## dev3000: Smart Debugging Orchestrator

**dev3000 doesn't just work alone - it's designed to intelligently enhance its capabilities by orchestrating your entire MCP debugging ecosystem!** üéº

### üéØ How Smart Integration Works

**Core Mode** (dev3000 alone):
- Complete log analysis, browser automation, error detection, interaction replay
- All essential debugging functionality available immediately
- Zero dependencies - works great out of the box

**Enhanced Mode** (with specialized MCPs):
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Real-time detection of available MCP capabilities via log introspection
- **Capability-Aware Suggestions**: Context-sensitive recommendations based on discovered MCP functions
- **Augmented Delegation**: Provides comprehensive dev3000 analysis PLUS enhanced MCP suggestions
- **Self-Updating Intelligence**: Automatically adapts when MCPs add new capabilities - no manual updates required

### üöÄ Key Innovation: Dynamic Capability Discovery

Unlike static integrations that become outdated, dev3000 features **living integration** that:

- **Introspects MCP Logs**: Analyzes Claude's MCP communication logs to discover available functions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Uses intelligent regex patterns to extract function names and descriptions
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatically classifies capabilities as "advanced" vs "basic"
- **Context Matching**: Prioritizes suggestions based on current error patterns

## Using the Chrome Extension vs Playwright

dev3000 supports two monitoring modes:

### Default: Playwright Browser Automation

By default, dev3000 launches a Playwright-controlled Chrome instance for comprehensive monitoring.

### Alternative: Chrome Extension

For a lighter approach, install the dev3000 Chrome extension to monitor your existing browser session.

#### Installing the Chrome Extension

Since the extension isn't published to the Chrome Web Store, install it locally:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Navigate to your dev3000 installation directory and select the `chrome-extension` folder
5. The extension will now monitor localhost tabs automatically

#### Using with --servers-only

When using the Chrome extension, start dev3000 with the `--servers-only` flag to skip Playwright:

```bash
dev3000 --servers-only
```

#### Comparison

| Feature             | Playwright (Default)     | Chrome Extension        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Setup**           | Automatic                | Manual install required |
| **Performance**     | Higher resource usage    | Lightweight             |
| **Browser Control** | Full automation support  | Monitoring only         |
| **User Experience** | Separate browser window  | Your existing browser   |
| **Screenshots**     | Automatic on events      | Manual via extension    |
| **Best For**        | Automated testing, CI/CD | Development debugging   |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does dev3000 save my login state?

Yes, login state is saved automatically in a unique browser profile for each project. No need to re-login.

### How do I stop a dev3000 session?

Use `make dev-down` to stop the development environment, or `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running dev3000.

### Does dev3000 work with other frameworks besides Next.js?

Yes, it works with React, Vue, Vite, etc. Deploy your own app by copying it to the `frontend/` directory and rebuilding.

### Why do I see a warning about "sharp" during installation?

This warning is harmless and can be safely ignored. Sharp is an optional image optimization library used by Next.js, but dev3000 has image optimization disabled (`images: { unoptimized: true }` in next.config.mjs) since all images are served locally. The warning appears because pnpm wants to run sharp's build script, but the library is never actually used at runtime.

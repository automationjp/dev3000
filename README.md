## What it does

Creates a comprehensive log of your development session that AI assistants can easily understand. When you have a bug or issue, Claude can see your server output, browser console, network requests, and screenshots all in chronological order.

The tool monitors your app in a real browser and captures:

- Server logs and console output
- Browser console messages and errors
- Network requests and responses
- Automatic screenshots on navigation, errors, and key events
- Visual timeline at `http://localhost:3684/logs`

![dev3000 Logs Viewer](logs.jpg)

Logs are automatically saved with timestamps in `/var/log/dev3000/` (or temp directory) and rotated to keep the 10 most recent per project. Each instance has its own timestamped log file displayed when starting dev3000.

## dev3000: Smart Debugging Orchestrator

## Using the Chrome Extension vs Playwright

dev3000 supports two monitoring modes:

### Default: Playwright Browser Automation

By default, dev3000 launches a Playwright-controlled Chrome instance for comprehensive monitoring.

### Alternative: Chrome Extension

For a lighter approach, install the dev3000 Chrome extension to monitor your existing browser session.

#### Installing the Chrome Extension

Since the extension isn't published to the Chrome Web Store, install it locally:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Navigate to your dev3000 installation directory and select the `chrome-extension` folder
5. The extension will now monitor localhost tabs automatically

#### Using with --servers-only

When using the Chrome extension, start dev3000 with the `--servers-only` flag to skip Playwright:

```bash
dev3000 --servers-only
```

#### Comparison

| Feature             | Playwright (Default)     | Chrome Extension        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Setup**           | Automatic                | Manual install required |
| **Performance**     | Higher resource usage    | Lightweight             |
| **Browser Control** | Full automation support  | Monitoring only         |
| **User Experience** | Separate browser window  | Your existing browser   |
| **Screenshots**     | Automatic on events      | Manual via extension    |
| **Best For**        | Automated testing, CI/CD | Development debugging   |

## Options

```bash
dev3000 [options]

  -p, --port <port>         Your app's port (default: 3000)
  --mcp-port <port>         MCP server port (default: 3684)
  -s, --script <script>     Package.json script to run (default: dev)
  -c, --command <command>   Custom command to run (overrides auto-detection and --script)
  --browser <path>          Full path to browser executable (e.g. Arc, custom Chrome)
  --servers-only            Run servers only, skip browser launch (use with Chrome extension)
  --profile-dir <dir>       Chrome profile directory (default: /tmp/dev3000-chrome-profile)
```

Examples:

```bash
# Custom port
dev3000 --port 5173

# Custom command (skip auto-detection)
dev3000 --command "bun run dev"

# Custom Python server
dev3000 --command "uvicorn main:app --reload" --port 8000

# Use Arc browser
dev3000 --browser '/Applications/Arc.app/Contents/MacOS/Arc'

# Use with Chrome extension (no Playwright)
dev3000 --servers-only

# Custom profile directory
dev3000 --profile-dir ./chrome-profile
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does dev3000 save my login state?

Yes, login state is saved automatically in a unique browser profile for each project. No need to re-login.

### How do I stop a dev3000 session?

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop everything (server, browser, and MCP server).

### Does dev3000 work with other frameworks besides Next.js?

Yes, it works with React, Vue, Vite, etc. Use `--script` to specify your dev command.

### Why do I see a warning about "sharp" during installation?

This warning is harmless and can be safely ignored. Sharp is an optional image optimization library used by Next.js, but dev3000 has image optimization disabled (`images: { unoptimized: true }` in next.config.mjs) since all images are served locally. The warning appears because pnpm wants to run sharp's build script, but the library is never actually used at runtime.

- `pnpm run test-release` - Run comprehensive release tests (includes all of the above plus build, pack, and MCP server tests)

## Releasing (Maintainers Only)

We use a semi-automated release process that handles testing while accommodating npm's 2FA requirement:

### Option 1: GitHub Actions + Manual Publish (Recommended)

1. Go to [Actions](https://github.com/vercel-labs/dev3000/actions) ‚Üí "Prepare Release"
2. Select release type (patch/minor/major) and run
3. Wait for tests to pass on all platforms
4. Download the release artifact (tarball)
5. Publish locally: `./scripts/publish.sh dev3000-*.tgz`

### Option 2: Local Release

```bash
./scripts/release.sh  # Creates tag and updates version
./scripts/publish.sh  # Publishes to npm (requires 2FA)
git push origin main --tags
```

The release script automatically handles re-releases by cleaning up existing tags if needed.

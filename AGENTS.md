# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

Build the project:

```bash
pnpm run build
# or with tsx for development
pnpm run dev
```

Test canary builds:

```bash
pnpm run canary
# or directly: scripts/canary.sh
```

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses pnpm exclusively. Always use pnpm commands, never npm. When making changes to this codebase:

- Use `pnpm install` to install dependencies
- never run `pnpm build` - we test manually and have a release and publish script

**CRITICAL**: NEVER run `pnpm run release` or any publish commands unless the user explicitly says "release" or "publish". Always wait for explicit permission before releasing versions.

**RELEASE PROCESS**: When releasing, ONLY use `pnpm run release` - this script handles the entire process:

1. Builds and tests the project
2. Bumps the version and creates git tags
3. Pushes to GitHub
4. Publishes to npm with OTP authentication
5. Sets up the next canary version for development
   NEVER manually run `pnpm publish`, `pnpm version`, or individual release steps - let the script handle everything.

**USER PREFERENCE**: The user prefers pnpm for all package management. When suggesting installation commands to users, always use pnpm (e.g., `pnpm install -g dev3000`) instead of npm.

The default server command in CLI is `pnpm dev` but can be overridden with `--server-command`.

## Architecture Overview

This is a TypeScript npm package that provides AI-powered development tools for Next.js projects. The architecture consists of:

**CLI Entry Point** (`src/cli.ts`):

- Uses Commander.js for CLI interface
- Two main commands: `start` (dev environment) and `setup` (project setup)
- Default command is `start` if no subcommand provided

**Core Components**:

1. **Project Setup** (`src/setup.ts`):

   - Installs MCP (Model Context Protocol) API routes in Next.js app directory
   - Creates `app/api/mcp/[transport]/route.ts` with three tools: `read_consolidated_logs`, `search_logs`, `get_browser_errors`
   - Updates package.json with `dev:ai` script and dependencies (`mcp-handler`, `zod`)
   - Manages .gitignore entries for `ai-dev-tools/` directory

2. **Development Environment** (`src/dev-environment.ts`):
   - Orchestrates any dev server + browser monitoring via Playwright
   - Works with any web framework (Next.js, Vite, etc.)
   - Checks port availability before starting (defaults: 3000 for app, 3684 for MCP server)
   - If ports are in use, displays process IDs and kill command instead of auto-killing
   - Uses persistent Chrome profile and captures unified logs
   - Monitors console logs, network requests, page errors, navigation events
   - Takes automatic screenshots on errors and route changes

**MCP Integration**: The generated route provides AI assistants with tools to analyze development logs in real-time. Tools can read recent logs, search with regex patterns, and extract browser errors from specified time periods.

**Log Format**: Unified timestamps with source prefixes:

```
[2025-08-30T12:54:03.033Z] [SERVER] Ready on http://localhost:3000
[2025-08-30T12:54:03.435Z] [BROWSER] [CONSOLE LOG] App initialized
```

**Target Use Case**: Designed for Next.js 15+ projects with app directory structure. The tool creates isolated browser profiles and consolidated logging to enable AI-assisted debugging and development workflow analysis.
